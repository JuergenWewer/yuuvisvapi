check that everything works with:

[source]
----
mvn test exec:java
----

The command compiles the project and runs the tests, then  it launches the application, so you can check by yourself. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080. You should see a _Hello World_ message.

== Anatomy of the project

The project contains:

* a `pom.xml` file
* a _main_ verticle file (src/main/java/io/vertx/starter/MainVerticle.java)
* an unit test (src/main/test/io/vertx/starter/MainVerticleTest.java)

Run `redeploy.sh` and the project recompiles while editing.

NOTE: the `redeploy` script are also configurable

== Building the project

To build the project, just use:

----
mvn clean package
----

It generates a _fat-jar_ in the `target` directory.

build and create docker image:

mvn clean install

To compile, build, and push the image to a remote repo:
mvn clean deploy -Ddocker.user=<username> -Ddocker.password=<passwd> -Ddocker.url=<docker-registry-url>
